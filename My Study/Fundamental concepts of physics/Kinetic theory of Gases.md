# Introduction
- For low densities, ideal gases obey $pV = nRT$
- _n_ is the number of moles, and $R=8.314 JK^-1mol^-1$
- We define an ideal gas as that which always obeys the above equation.
- A **molecule** is the smallest unit having all the chemical properties of the sample.
- Assumptions of kinetic theory of gases:
	- All gases are made of molecules moving randomly in all directions!
	- Molecules are tiny compared to distances between molecules
	- Except during collision, no forces are exerted on anything by anyone, including on walls
	- collisions are perfectly elastic and time of collision is negligibly small
	- The molecules obey Newton's laws of motion(Wait, really?)
	- After reaching steady state, the desity and distribution of molecules with different velocities are independent of _position, direction and time!_
- So, distribution of molecules don't change? What does this imply? Think of it as a self-balancing system. If a molecule traveling along positive x axis collides with another, and changes its velocity to -x, then there *has* to be another molecule somewhere that just changed its velocity to +x! We can thus assume that nothing changed whatsoever and this makes our math simpler!
- By the way, the collisions ar eelastic if the temperature of the walls are equal to the temperature of the temperature of the gas. (_Think about why!_)

# Calculating the pressure of an ideal gas
##  Basic Derivation
Molecule collides with wall, thereby reversing its velocity along one of the axes, say x axis for the sake of our calculations.
Change in momentum:
